# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## üöÄ PROJECT OVERVIEW

This machine learning-based project predicts fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset for this end contains details about transactions and features engineered from anonymized variables due to confidentiality concerns. The primary goal is to correctly classify fraudulent transactions, simultaneously ensuring a high precision and recall rate so that false positives and false negatives are reduced to a great extent.

## üîç Key Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Raw data preparation along with handling imbalanced classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Design of meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model such as XGBoost on the classification problem.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model performance could be assessed, along with possible improvement areas.

## üìÇ Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset by [https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ]
- **284,807 transactions** with 31 features each .
- **Feature description**:
  - `V1, V2,., V28`: PCA-based anonymization of principal components.
  - `Time`: Seconds between this transaction and the first one.
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `Class`: Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting framework for model training.
 
## üìà Project Steps
 
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Class Distribution Visualization
   Understanding Feature Relationships and Patterns
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Handling Missing Values, if any.
- Class imbalance techniques such as **SMOTE** or **class weighting**.
3. Model Training:
Develop a baseline logistic regression model to benchmark against.
Train an XGBoost model for better performance.
4. Model Evaluation:
Use metrics in play that encompass **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** beyond the **F1-score** and the **confusion matrix**.
Run cross-validation to ensure that any given model is resilient
- visualization of feature importances so that I can understand which variables are most contributing to the predictions of the model.

## üîß Model Perfomance

- **XGBoost Model Results**:
  - Accuracy: 1.00
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score: All for both classes
  - Confusion Matrix:
- It detected a lot of non-fraudulent transactions and was not that effective in detecting fraud ones.

## What's Next?
 
- Improve Model
  Other models may be applied, which are **Random Forest** or **Neural Networks**.
- Hyperparameter Tuning
  Techniques like **GridSearchCV** or **RandomSearchCV** are used.
- Deploy the Model
  Use either Flask or FastAPI so as to integrate to any web application for real-time predictions.
- **Improve Handling of Class Imbalance**:
  - Attempt **undersampling** and **ensemble advanced methods**.
